LLTracker is a Android/Web application for public location sharing. I wanted to
try out my general programming knowledge in an unfamiliar format (Android, in
this case) with an unfamiliar language (kotlin) and get them working with a
simple web application.

The project has lots of potential for future development and would certainly
require security and scaling concerns to be addressed along with any feature
additions. Nonetheless, it was a fun challenge and exciting to get up and
running!

This repository holds the web application and server functionality, while the
Android application is separately located here: https://github.com/davidsmcdonald/lltracker_app
